Hydrometer for you is an app to keep track of water intake throughout the day and calculate the average amount of water the user drank
//first layout is a splash screen that displays the name and student number of the user
second layout is for collecting the user's water consumption data throughout the day and notes about the situation when the user is drinking water,these will be called hydration notes
the data will be collected in the form of a date,the amount of water the user drank in the morning,the amount of water user drank in the afternoon and hydration notes
values for amount of water consumed are stored in arrays with each being separate for morning  and afternoon but they share the same index thus making them parallel arrays
the user will input the date which will also be stored in an array at the same index as the values for water consumed thus ensuring that no confusion of data will occur  
when all the slots for data to be input have been filled the user will be requested to delete older data so as to create a vacancy for a fresh set of hydration data
